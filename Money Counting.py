# Money Counting Game
#
# Create a change-counting game that gets the user to 
# enter the number of coins required to make exactly 
# one dollar. The program should prompt the user to 
# enter the number of pennies, nickels, dimes, and 
# quarters. If the total value of the coins entered 
# is equal to one dollar, the program should congratulate 
# the user for winning the game. Otherwise, the program 
# should display a message indicating whether the amount 
# entered was more than or less than one dollar.
